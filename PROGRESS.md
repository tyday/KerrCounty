# Project Progress

## Phase 0: Initial setup
- [x] Estimate storage size of minutes
- [x] Download all .txt and .pdf files
- [x] Add project specification file

## Phase 1: Bare Bones MCP Access (Week 1)
- [ ] Basic file reader for TXT files in `minutes/` folder
- [ ] Minimal MCP server with `list_files()` and `read_file(filename)`
- [ ] Test Claude can list and read files through MCP

## Phase 2: Basic Search + Testing (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement basic string search across files
- [ ] Add MCP functions: `search_text(query)`, `get_file_metadata(filename)`
- [ ] Test search for "flood" or "emergency" terms
- [ ] Validate MCP connection stability with Claude

## Phase 3: Enhanced Search + Metadata (Week 3)
- [ ] Extract meeting dates, attendees from file headers (metadata parsing)
- [ ] Add date range filtering and multiple keyword support
- [ ] Add MCP functions: `search_by_date_range(start_date, end_date)`, `search_with_filters(query, filters)`
- [ ] Test complex queries with Claude for flood research

## Phase 4: AI Integration + Analysis (Week 4)
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI for summarization and Q&A
- [ ] Implement topic extraction (basic keyword identification)
- [ ] Add MCP functions: `summarize_meeting(filename)`, `answer_question(query, context_files)`
- [ ] Test Claude's ability to analyze patterns across meetings

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5+)
- [ ] Integrate FAISS for semantic search
- [ ] Implement cross-referencing of related meetings
- [ ] Add timeline analysis for topics over time
- [ ] Build full React web interface

## Stretch Goals / Backlog
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (meeting participation, topic frequency, decision patterns)
- [ ] Real-time integration for auto-downloading new minutes
- [ ] Multi-county support
- [ ] Advanced NLP: Named entity recognition for people, places, organizations
